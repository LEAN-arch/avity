        **Methodology:** A hierarchical visualization that shows how a total value is allocated across multiple levels. The angle of each arc is proportional to its budget value relative to its parent.

        **Significance & Insights:** Instantly identifies the largest cost drivers. You can see that "External Manufacturing" is the biggest category, and drill down to see which programs and sub-categories are the most significant investments.

        **Managerial Actionability:**
        - **Action:** Justifies where to focus cost-control efforts. A small percentage saving on the largest segment has a much bigger impact than a large saving on a small segment.
        - **Action:** Provides a clear visual to use when presenting budget plans to finance or senior leadership.

        - **Actual > Forecast:** You are spending faster than planned. This could be due to accelerated activities or cost overruns.
        - **Actual < Forecast:** You are spending slower than planned. This could indicate project delays or cost savings.

        **Managerial Actionability:**
        - **Action:** Investigate any significant variances to understand the root cause. This is a critical input for re-forecasting future spend and managing the overall annual budget.
